## About Mockupp
Mockupp is a tool built with React for creating browser-style mockups for presentations and portfolios. You upload your design and can customize the browser appearance and background. The app is in its early stages of development - I'm aware that there are bugs that exist and I'm currently working on fixing them as well as adding new features.<br>
Features include:
- Upload design image (PNG, JPG, GIF, or SVG)
- Customize browser:
    - URL
    - Navigation button style
    - Drop shadow
- Customize background:
    - Choose color with color picker popup tool
    - Upload image (PNG, JPG, GIF, or SVG)
- Full screen display
- More coming soon...

## Coming soon
- Full site located at [mockupp.io](https://mockupp.io)
    - React SPA including landing page with samples
- Additional features:
    - Chrome-style nav bar option in addition to the current Safari-style default
    - Two-color split backgrounds
    - Show/hide:
        - Entire nav bar
        - Three browser nav buttons
    - Resize browser mockup as resizes window (more of a bug fix than a new feature!)
    - Other features that Iâ€™d like to add in the future:
        - Upload Figma & Sketch files
        - Drag and drop file upload
        - Other built-in background styles, including integrating third-party tools (gradients, etc.)
        - Upload a larger image, such as a full-length page of a site, and allow for scrolling
