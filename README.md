## About Mockupp
Mockupp is a tool built with React for creating browser-style mockups for presentations and portfolios. You upload your design and can customize the browser appearance and background. The app is in its early stages of development - I'm aware that there are bugs that exist and I'm currently working on fixing them as well as adding new features.

I built Mockupp after spending a lot of time on sites like Dribbble where the majority of users showcase their site designs in a mockup browser with a drop shadow and on top of a solid background or a simple pattern. Although it's a relatively quick process to create such a mockup in Figma, Sketch, or another design software, I wanted to create an app that allowed for such a presentation in seconds. In addition, it also allows more amateur designers and developers (like myself) to present their work in a manner that looks more professional. These mockups can be used in a personal portfolio, on showcase sites like Dribbble or Behance, or even in a presentation in a professional setting (although I can't say I've done it yet myself ðŸ˜‰). I wanted to add features that would improve the presentation of the design and have some more ideas in mind (details below).

Features include:
- Upload design image (PNG, JPG, GIF, or SVG)
- Customize browser:
    - URL
    - Navigation button style
    - Drop shadow
- Customize background:
    - Choose color with color picker popup tool
    - Upload image (PNG, JPG, GIF, or SVG)
- Full screen display
- More coming soon...

## Coming soon
- Full site located at [mockupp.io](https://mockupp.io)
- Additional features:
    - Chrome-style nav bar option in addition to the current Safari-style default
    - Two-color split backgrounds
    - Show/hide:
        - Entire nav bar
        - Three browser nav buttons
    - Other features that Iâ€™d like to add in the future:
        - Upload Figma & Sketch files
        - Drag and drop file upload
        - Other built-in background styles, including integrating third-party tools (gradients, etc.)
        - Upload a larger image, such as a full-length page of a site, and allow for scrolling

_Credit to GitHub for the third example on the landing page ([primer.style](https://primer.style)) and Savee for the fourth ([savee.it](https://savee.it)). I thought they were both really nice designs and wanted to use them as examples after my two own ([Throww](https://github.com/johnbarkley/throww) and my [portfolio site](http://johngbarkley.com))._
