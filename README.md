## About Mockupp
Mockupp is a tool for creating browser-style mockups for presentations and portfolios. You upload your design and can customize the browser appearance and background. The app is in its early stages of development - I'm aware that there are bugs that exist and I'm currently working on fixing them as well as adding new features.
Features include:
- Upload design image (PNG, JPG, GIF, or SVG)
- Customize browser:
    - URL
    - Navigation button style
    - Drop shadow
- Customize background:
    - Choose color with color picker popup tool
    - Upload image (PNG, JPG, GIF, or SVG)
- Full screen display
- More features coming soon...

## Coming soon
- Full site located at mockupp.io
    - React SPA including landing page with samples
- Additional features:
    - Chrome nav bar option in addition to current default Safari
    - Two color backgrounds
    - Show/hide:
        - Nav bar
        - Three browser nav buttons

    - Other features that Iâ€™d like to add in the future:
        - Upload Figma & Sketch files
        - Drag and drop file upload
        - Other built-in background styles, including integrating third-party tools (gradients, etc.)
        - Upload a larger image, such as a full-length page of a site, and allow for scrolling
